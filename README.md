# SFAE - Starfield Achievement Enabler

Allows you to earn achievements while using mods and console commands

This does not fix your savefile if it has already been marked as a modded savefile.

## Info
Made for and tested with the Steam version
on Windows 10

You can enable a console window if you want - simply create a file named "sfae.console" within the Starfield directory

This console window doesn't offer much but may be useful for debugging or just making sure it works

## Installation

Simply drop **vcruntime140_1.dll** within the Starfield directory (Same one that has Starfield.exe), that's it!

For default install locations:
Steam: "**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield**" on a standard Steam install.
GamePass "**C:\XboxGames\Starfield\Content**" (Support for GamePass is not guaranteed but seems to work for now)


---
When you open the in-game console for the first time, you will see a message from SFAE telling you if it is working or not:
