# SFAE - Starfield Achievement Enabler
Allows you to earn achievements while using mods or console commands

## Info
Made for and tested with the Steam version
on Windows 10

You can enable a console window if you want - simply create a file named "sfae.console" within the Starfield directory

This console window doesn't offer much but may be useful for debugging or just making sure it works
