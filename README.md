# SFAE - Starfield Achievement Enabler

Allows you to earn achievements while using mods and console commands

This does not fix your savefile if it has already been marked as a modded savefile.

## Info
Made for and tested with the Steam version
on Windows 10

You can enable a console window if you want - simply create a file named "sfae.console" within the Starfield directory

This console window doesn't offer much but may be useful for debugging or just making sure it works

## Installation
Simply drop **vcruntime140_1.dll** within the Starfield directory (Same one that has Starfield.exe), that's it!
This would be "**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield**" on a standard Steam install.

Or

It should also work with any type of .ASI loader

If it is working as intended then you will see this when opening the ingame console for the first time of your game session:
