# SFAE - Starfield Achievement Enabler

Allows you to earn achievements while using mods and console commands

This does not fix your savefile if it has already been marked as a modded savefile.

## Info
Made for and tested with the Steam version
on Windows 10

You can enable a console window if you want - simply create a file named "sfae.console" within the Starfield directory

This console window doesn't offer much but may be useful for debugging or just making sure it works

## Installation
Simply drop **vcruntime140_1.dll** within the Starfield directory (Same one that has Starfield.exe), that's it!

(If you had the previous **dxgi.dll** installed, you need to remove it)

Or

It should also work with any type of .ASI loader
