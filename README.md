# SFAE - Starfield Achievement Enabler

Allows you to earn achievements while using mods and console commands

This does not fix your savefile if it has already been marked as a modded savefile.

## Info
Made for and tested with the Steam version
on Windows 10

You can enable console and change other settings in sfae.cfg

## Installation

Simply drop **vcruntime140_1.dll** within the Starfield directory (Same one that has Starfield.exe), that's it!


For default install locations:

Steam: "**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield**"

GamePass: "**C:\XboxGames\Starfield\Content**" (Support for GamePass is not guaranteed but seems work)

### Configuration
The first time you run the game with SFAE installed it will generate sfae.cfg within the installation folder
with settings you may edit to your liking

e.g "**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield\sfae.cfg**"

---
If you have **ShowInGameMessage** set to true in the config, you will see a message the first time you open

the in-game console for the first time, you will see a message from SFAE telling you if it is working or not:

There is also a logfile within the install directory: sfae.log
